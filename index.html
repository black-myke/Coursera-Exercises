                Static Positioning is the default position for HTML elements.<br/>
                Elements with the position: Static are positioned based on the normal flow 
                of the page, as you would expecct them to be without any CSS.

        <div class="section section-2">
            <p class="sub-heading sub-heading-2">Relative</p>
            <p class="content content-2">
                Relative Positioning is a postion property that the element is positioned relative
                to its normal position. The offsets (top, bottom, left, right) will cause the element
                to be adjusted from its normal position but would not be taken from its normal flow.
            </p>

        <div class="section section-3">
            <p class="sub-heading sub-heading-3">Absolute</p>
            <p class="content content-3">
                Absolute Positioning is a postion property that takes the targeted elements
                out of its normal document flow.<br/> The offsets (top, bottom, left, right) are
                relative to the position of the nearest ancestor which has a positioning set on it.
